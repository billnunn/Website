    "text": "I encountered this problem in the first sheet of a ‘Numerical Linear Algebra’ module.\nStatement: Let \\(U\\) be an \\(n\\) by \\(n\\) upper triangular matrix which is zero along the diagonal, show \\(U^n=0\\). In other words show that such a \\(U\\) is nilpotent.\nThe standard solution is to consider how the matrix \\(U\\) acts on each of the standard basis vectors- the image of \\(U^k\\) is the span of the remaining \\(n-k\\) vectors."
