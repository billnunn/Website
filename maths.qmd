title: "Maths"
---

This page contains four distinct sections:

-   **Digests**- Succinct written pieces about maths and doing maths.

-   **Problems**- Explanations of any briefly stated problem I'm stumped by. Problems which get resolved may be turned into digests.

-   **Talks**- Slides or posters for presentations I've given.

-   **Preprints/Publications**- Self explanatory.

Each section is internally ordered by date, with the most recently written documents highest.
