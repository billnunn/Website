title: "An alternative proof"
---

I encountered this exercise on the first sheet of a 'Numerical Linear Algebra' module.

**Problem Statement:** Let $U$ be an $n$ by $n$ upper triangular matrix which is zero along the diagonal, show $U^n=0$. In other words, show that such a $U$ is nilpotent.

**Thoughts:** The standard solution is to consider how the matrix $U$ acts on each of the standard basis vectors: the image of $U^k$ is the span of the remaining $n-k$ vectors.

An alternative way to approach the problem (and the approach I thought of before the standard solution) is to view $U$ as an adjacency matrix of a weighted digraph.

Let's restrict our view to a special matrix $S$ which has one in all it's entries above the diagonal. Consider a graph $G$ of $n$ nodes labelled $1$ to $n$, and let $S$ be the adjacency matrix. This is a complete digraph that has each directed from the node with the smaller label to the node with the larger label.

Now, the $(i,j)$th entry of matrix $S^k$ is the number of directed paths of length $k$ from node $i$ to node $j$. The longest directed path in graph $G$ is the the path $1,2,3,â€¦,n$ but this only has length $n-1$, and we conclude that $S^n=0$.

The proof adapts fairly easily to matrix $U$, but is a bit messier. We start with a new notation: for directed path $P$ we let $E_m(P)$ denote the weight of the $m$th directed edge. The way we can adapt the proof is to observe that the $(i,j)$th entry of matrix of $U^k$ is given by:

$$
\sum_{P}\prod_{m=1}^{k}E_m(P)
$$

Where we are summing over the directed paths $P$ of length $k$ from $i$ to $j$.
